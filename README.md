# KBS_LTER_Crop_microbiome
Shared Space for Those working on the KBS LTER Microbiome project.

In this project we work on:

  -Microbiomes from rotational crop soil, roots, stems and leaves. This is the origin
  
  -Micriobiomes from conventional, no-till, and organic management systems. This is called manangement systems.
  
  -Microbiomes from different growth stages (soybean V2, R3, R6). This is growth stage
  
  -If you see a label in a mappingfile labelled "bar_label" that is a mix of the management system and growth stage in some form.
